## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

First, grab a copy of this repo and install the needed dependencies to run Papillon locally.

```sh
npm i
```

### Installation
*PS: In an older version of this file, you had to install the `@ionic/cli` package. This package is no longer needed, and if you installed it only for Papillon, you can remove it with `npm uninstall -g @ionic/cli`.*
*We removed it to fix a bug with "Waiting for connectivity with vue-cli-service" message which was CPU intensive.*
To run papillon, simply run
```sh
npm run serve
```

To build papillon, you need **Android Studio** or *Xcode** installed.
Android SDK or Xcode command line tools needs to be configured. All the prerequisites for building are available on https://capacitorjs.com/docs/getting-started/environment-setup
```sh
npm run build
npx cap sync
# then build using Android Studio or Xcode
```

## Usage
